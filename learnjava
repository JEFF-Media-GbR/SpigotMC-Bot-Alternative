  - <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java>
  - <https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1068>
  - <https://www.learnjavaonline.org/>
  - <https://programmingbydoing.com/>
  - <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html>

The last one is the only official one, however some of those concepts assume that you already know a bit about programming.
